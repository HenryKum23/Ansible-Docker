How to Use Ansible to Install Docker from an Ansible Control Node onto an Ubuntu Remote Server
Prerequisites:

    Ansible Control Node: An Ubuntu 22.04 machine with Ansible installed and configured for SSH key-based authentication to connect to your Ansible hosts.

    Remote Server with Ubuntu 20.04: This server requires SSH access from the Ansible control node. It will be configured as an Ansible host for automated provisioning.

Files Created for Execution as a Role:

    AnsibleKey1.pem: Contains the SSH keypair for the Ansible control node, facilitating SSH connections to remote servers.

    Ansible.cfg: Configures settings such as creating a new sudo user with passwordless sudo setup, and disabling password-based authentication for the root user.

    Config: Includes tasks to install aptitude, preferred by Ansible, and necessary system packages.

    Docker: Defines tasks related to Docker installation within the playbook.

    Inventory: Lists all hosts and child hosts with their IP addresses and associated SSH keypairs for communication from the control host.

    Playbook.yaml: Defines all automation tasks. Each task represents a specific action automated using Ansible.

Steps:

Step 1:
The AnsibleKey1.pem file contains the SSH keypair allowing the Ansible control node to establish secure connections with remote Ubuntu servers.

Step 2:
Ansible.cfg includes configurations:

    Creation of a new sudo user with passwordless sudo.
    Disabling password-based authentication for root and other related configurations.

Step 3:
The Config file installs aptitude and necessary system packages preferred by Ansible.

Step 4:
Tasks for Docker installation are defined within the Docker section of the playbook:

    Installs the latest Docker version from the official repository.
    Adds the Docker GPG key for verification.
    Adds the Docker official repository as a package source.
    Installs the Docker Python module.

Step 5:
The Inventory file lists all host machines and their respective IP addresses, configured with SSH keypairs for connectivity from the Ansible control node.

Step 6:
Playbook.yaml contains all defined tasks. Each task represents a specific action automated through Ansible playbooks, which are the building blocks of automation.

This description provides a clear outline of how Ansible is used to automate the installation of Docker on remote Ubuntu servers, detailing necessary prerequisites, configuration files, and steps involved in the process.
